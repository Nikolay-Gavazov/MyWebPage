            knack for crafting innovative digital solutions.I find my
            inspiration in the dynamic world of technology and the boundless

          <h3>A Bit About My Journey</h3>
        </header>
        <main>
          <p>
            Originally from Bulgaria, I've always been fascinated by the
            intersection of mechanics and software. With a background in
            Mechanical Engineering, I've honed my skills to marry the precision
            of engineering with the creativity of web development.

        </header>
        <main>
          <p>
            When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll likely find me
            indulging in my hobbies. I have a deep love for cars, often spending
            my weekends tinkering under the hood or hitting the open road.
            Football matches are a must-watch for me, and I never say no to a
            thrilling off-road adventure or a karting session.

        </header>
        <main>
          <p>
            In my arsenal, I wield a variety of tools and technologies. From
            React, Next.js and Angular to Node.js and Express.js, I thrive on
            the versatility of frameworks and languages like TypeScript and
            Vanilla JavaScript. I'm adept at handling databases like MongoDB and
            SQL Server, and I streamline my development process with tools like
            Postman and GitHub. When it comes to design, I turn to Figma to
            bring my ideas to life, and for mobile app development, I rely on
            Ionic.
